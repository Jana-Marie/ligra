## 3-Point Stage

My earliest attempt, make a 3-point connected stage for trapez-correction. I designed and built one, it worked, but was so flimsy. Didn't keep on improving it, but eventually an overhaul is due.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/Screenshot from 2025-01-04 12-20-47.png"/>
      </td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Oil Disc

Another fun stage is to use a 70s style oil disc. They are available from Mathmos or used on ebay, but require some modification to the whole frame.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/Screenshot from 2025-01-04 12-24-28.png"/>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/11bd2950d9579037.jpg"/>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/263e70de6c5d269f.jpg"/>
      </td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
